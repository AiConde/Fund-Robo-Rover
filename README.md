# Fund-Robo-Rover
This repository contains shared files for team 1's final project in Fundamentals of Robotics, Spring 2022.

There are two file categories: CAD files (mostly SOLIDWORKS files) and robot control code (mostly MATLAB files with some ROS mixed in).

The sensor features of the rover are:

LiDAR: 1 Hokuyo URG-005
Sonar: 2 MaxBotix MB1040
Infared: 6 Sharp GP2Y0A02YK0F
Camera: 1 SVPRO 8-megapixel webcam, 5-50 mm focus

Logic is run on an intel NUC running Ubuntu and logic/motor controls are routed through an Arduino Nano connected to a HiLetgo Nano v3.
